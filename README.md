# Introduction
Pegasus is the code name for a tool that was developed during a ShipIt event at Oracle.  It's purpose is to make creating and finding "objects" in Fusion Applications easier and prevent duplication of Objects.

Pegasus tries to solve this by making it easy to find anything, anywhere, anytime in Fusion.

# Prerequisites
Pegasus was build with Grunt, Bower and Yeoman so you need these tools to get started.  All these tools also have a dependancy on Node.js and npm so install those first.

## node.js and npm
### Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
### Mac (using Brew)
$ brew install node

## Yeoman, Grunt and Bower
### Ubuntu
sudo npm install yeoman -g
